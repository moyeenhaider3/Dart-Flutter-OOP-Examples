/**
 * Abstraction Example
 * 
 * Imagine you have a toy robot. This robot has buttons on its surface,
 * and when you press a button, it performs a specific actionâ€”let's say dancing.
 * Now, abstraction is like focusing on the dance itself without worrying about
 * how the robot's internal gears or circuits make it happen.
 * 
 * In computer programming, abstraction allows you to focus on what something does
 * rather than how it does it. It's like using the dance button on your robot without
 * needing to understand the complex mechanics inside.
 * 
 * Why is Abstraction Important?
 * Abstraction is important because it simplifies things. Instead of dealing with intricate details,
 * you can interact with something based on its essential features, making it easier to use and understand.
 * 
 * Imagine: Think of abstraction as using the dance button on your robot without caring about
 * the gears and circuits inside. In programming, abstraction lets you focus on what things do,
 * abstracting away the complex details of how they do it.
